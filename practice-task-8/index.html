						Samosa Sweet Potatoes Wraps
					</b>
					<p class="recipe__info__text">
						When we travel, we often make wraps to bring with us as a meal during our trip. They tend to be way more wholesome and delicious than the fast (and often expensive) options that are available at the airport or train station.
					</p>
					<p class="recipe__info__text">
						Like most of our dishes, it's all about the toppings, and I think it's a must to have some sliced avocado, or at least a creamy dressing like our cashew lime or avocado garlic cream. I also like my wraps to be a bit more spicy with a little squirt of sriracha or a dollop of our Afghan Green Chutney.
					</p>
					<p class="recipe__info__text">
						These savoury wraps are easy to make and assemble the night before, just pop them in the microwave the next morning, and you are good to go (adding the avocado after it's been heated, preferably)! You can also make the fillings ahead of time and assemble the next day.

						Healthiest Ever Granola
					</b>
					<p class="recipe__info__text">
						This granola recipe is both sweet, because of the dates, raisins and dried cranberries, as well as savoury, because of the tahini. You can vary it up each time depending on the dried fruit or nuts and seeds you choose to add.
					</p>
					<p class="recipe__info__text">
						Let's walk through the step-by-step guide to make this yourself:
					</p>
					<ul class="recipe__info__list">
						<li>
							Step 1: gather your whole foods ingredients
						</li>
						<li>Step 2: create the date + tahini mixture by blending in a food processor</li>
						<li>Step 3: roughly chop your raw nuts</li>
						<li>Step 4: mix!</li>
						<li>
							Step 5: transfer to oven-safe dish lined with parchment paper
						</li>
						<li>Step 6: bake until golden and fragrant</li>
						<li>
							Step 7: serve with plant-based yogurt and fresh fruit - make it look pretty!
						</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="recipe__info__list recipe__info__list_ingredients">
						<li>1 cup (175 g) dates</li>
						<li>1/2 cup (120 mL) tahini</li>
						<li>
							3 cups (270 g) old-fashioned rolled oats (GF if desired)
						</li>
						<li>
							1 cup (140 g) raw mixed nuts (I used almond and cashew), roughly chopped
						</li>
						<li>1/2 cup (75 g) organic raisins</li>
						<li>1/4 cup (30 g) dried cranberries</li>
						<li>1/4 cup (35 g) raw sunflower seeds</li>
						<li>1/4 cup (35 g) raw pumpkin seeds</li>
						<li>1/4 cup (15 g) unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
						<li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
						<li>1/4 tsp salt (optional)</li>
					</ul>
					<ul class="recipe__info__list recipe__info__list_directions">
						<li>Preheat oven to 150 C / 300 F.</li>
						<li>
							Mix dates, tahini and 3 Tbsp (45 mL) water in a food processor and blend until creamy.
						</li>
						<li>
							And all ingredients to a large bowl and mix to combine.
						</li>
						<li>
							Spread granola evenly on baking paper and press flat. Bake for 30 minutes, or until golden brown, stopping one or two times to stir and flatten again if needed to prevent burning and to ensure the granola cooks evenly.
						</li>
						<li>
