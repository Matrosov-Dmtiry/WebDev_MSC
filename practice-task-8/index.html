						Samosa Sweet Potatoes Wraps
					</b>
					<p class="recipe__info__text">
						When we travel, we often make wraps to bring with us as a meal during our trip. They tend to be way more wholesome and delicious than the fast (and often expensive) options that are available at the airport or train station.
					</p>
					<p class="recipe__info__text">
						Like most of our dishes, it's all about the toppings, and I think it's a must to have some sliced avocado, or at least a creamy dressing like our cashew lime or avocado garlic cream. I also like my wraps to be a bit more spicy with a little squirt of sriracha or a dollop of our Afghan Green Chutney.
					</p>
					<p class="recipe__info__text">
						These savoury wraps are easy to make and assemble the night before, just pop them in the microwave the next morning, and you are good to go (adding the avocado after it's been heated, preferably)! You can also make the fillings ahead of time and assemble the next day.

						Frozen Yogurt Bars
					</b>
					<p class="recipe__info__text">
						A way to eat yogurt with one hand! These bars have a subtle sweetness and are rather filling thanks to the almond butter, oats and yogurt. This is a great breakfast for those who:<br/>- prefer a lighter breakfast in the morning<br/>- need grab-n-go options for rushed mornings<br/>- prefer a cooler breakfast in the warmer months
					</p>
